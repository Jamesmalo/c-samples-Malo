# C Projects
Instead of many repos each with their own project think as this as a portfolio of C projects to help you understand the syntax and concepts of C for future comparison.  Here is a good website for basic information on C syntax [Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/index.htm).  Use the left sidebar to scroll through topics.  Here is the link for the [online c compiler](https://www.onlinegdb.com/)

## List of topics
-  Structures
-  Pointers
-  Arrays
-  Standard IO

### Structures
You will make many struct definitions before the main method and create and destroy them inside the main method.

### Pointers
You will make many functions which accept, modify, and transmit pointer values.  You will use the main method to expose these side-effects.

### Arrays
You will create many arrays in the main method and overload them.  In this case you will create a few functions which extend the size of the array in question and replace it with a new reference.

### Standard IO
This means standard (ie command line) input and output.  These are programs which can be run form the command line that also accept parameters after the name of the file from the terminal (aka hacker window)
